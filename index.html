<h5>The injured Dallas Cowboys defensive back made it clear watching Monday Night Football last night: his brother, Stefon, needs to get out of Buffalo ASAP!</h5>
<p>There is some MAJOR drama in Buffalo! The Bills offense is a shadow of itself in 2023 from external and internal stressors. Last night, QB Josh Allen and the hometown Bills struggled in a third loss in four weeks.

This time to the often self-destructive Denver Broncos.

But last night's game highlighted a growing concern amongst Buffalo fans.

Josh Allen is a turnover machine who tries to do too much. The frustration of the skill players is boiling over to the point that the offensive coordinator - Ken Dorsey - was fired. Head coach Sean McDermott finds himself firmly on the hot seat with his talented squad now 5-5.</p>

<h2>Stefon Diggs, especially, has been frustrated.</h2>
<p>The elite wideout has been seen vocalizing his frustrations with the coaching staff and his QB on the sideline during games over the last season and a half.

Those frustrations might boil over into more if his brother - Dallas Cowboys DB Trevon Diggs - has any idea what his brother is going through/feeling about the trajectory of the franchise.</p>
